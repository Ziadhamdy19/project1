### **2. Embedded C Implementation (for STM32F103C6)**

Develop a complete Embedded C project containing:

* Source and header files (`.c` and `.h`) for each module.
* `startup.c` file for system initialization.
* `linker.ld` file for memory mapping.
* A complete `Makefile` to build the project.

---

### **3. Documentation and Simulation**

* Include **images** of each `.c` and `.h` file alongside its **corresponding state machine** in the report.
* Add **simulation results** with clear descriptions explaining system behavior.
* Generate and attach the following software analysis files:

  * `.map` file
  * Symbols table
  * Section tables
